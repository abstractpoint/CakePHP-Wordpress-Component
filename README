CakePHP Wordpress Component v0.2

= NOTICE ========
This component is a hack. Although it basically works its not a very elegant solution. I have plans to rewrite a proper Wordpress/CakePHP Plugin that will replace this.

= ABOUT =========
This CakePHP component integrates WordPress with CakePHP by utilizing 
the WordPress API.

WordPress and CakePHP don't like each other because of one little 
reason: The double underscore function. The "__()" function is an 
imcompatible global function between the frameworks. One solution is to 
rename or alter the function but that would require hundreds of hacks 
directly to WordPress, plugins, themes and/or CakePHP. 
That would be a nightmare.

This CakePHP component gets around the problem by accessing WordPress 
via a web service file. The solution uses 2 files: The CakePHP component 
and a PHP file that connects the component to the WordPress API. Input is 
sent to the web service file with POST variables and returned to the 
component JSON encoded. This way users can use this component even if 
they don't have SOAP or XML-RPC enabled on their server.
Further more this component takes advantage of the CakePHP caching 
system and uses a simple authentication system to keep unauthorized users 
from accessing your copy of WordPress through the web service file.

= INSTALL =======
1. Install WordPress into a folder in your CakePHP app/webroot/ folder.
2. Copy this plugin to the app/plugins/wordpress/ folder.
3. Copy the wordpress_service.php file from app/plugins/wordpress/webroot to your CakePHP app/webroot/ folder
4. Set the PASSWORD variable at the top of both files to any random string 
of characters. Just as long as they are the same.

= USAGE =========
* Add the component to your controller: var $components = array('Wordpress.Wordpress');
* Customize the component either by:
      o Directly edit the settings in the component file.
      o OR Specify settings in your controller: 
        var $components = array('Wordpress.Wordpress' => array('setting_name' => 'value'));
* Use the component: $this->Wordpress->wp_api_func_name('arg1', 'arg2');
* Visit the WordPress Codex for a list of available WordPress functions.

= SETTINGS ======
* PASSWORD
  Set to a random string of characters. This field should match the $PASSWORD 
  variable in the wordpress_service.php file. Used to ensure only the component 
  can access your WordPress API functions.

* PATH_TO_WP
  The absolute path to your WordPress folder. If you leave it blank it will assume 
  you have installed WordPress into a folder named 'wp' in your 
  CakePHP app/webroot/ folder.

* CACHE
  Set to true or false if you would like CakePHP to cache results from WordPress.

* WP_SERVICE_URL
  The relative URL to your wordpress_service.php file. If you have put the web 
  service file into your CakePHP app/webroot/ folder then leave it 
  set to '/wordpress_service.php'.
